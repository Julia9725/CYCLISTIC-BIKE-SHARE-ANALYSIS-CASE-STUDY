Cyclistic is a bike-share program based in Chicago, USA.
They launched in 2016 with the goal of providing a convenient and inclusive transportation option to both locals and visitors. 
As the company has grown, they have been able to distinguish their two customer types: casual riders (customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and Cyclistic members (customers who purchase annual memberships).
Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 
Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Lily Moreno, the marketing director, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. 
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. 
She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
