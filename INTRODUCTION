Cyclistic is a bike-share program based in Chicago, USA. Launched in 2016, the program aims to provide an eco-friendly and convenient transportation alternative for Chicago residents and visitors.
As the company has grown, it has expanded its services and customer base. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Lily, the company's marketing director, suggests focusing on converting casual riders into annual members rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers.
She notes that casual riders are already aware of the service but need more incentives to become annual members.
This case study aims to analyze the usage patterns of Cyclistic's bike-share program and identify strategies to increase annual memberships. 
The data for this analysis comes from Cyclistic's historical trip data, customer surveys, and financial records.
