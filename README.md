# CYCLISTIC-BIKE-SHARE-ANALYSIS-CASE-STUDY
# INTRODUCTION
Cyclistic is a bike-share program based in Chicago, USA. Launched in 2016, the program aims to provide an eco-friendly and convenient transportation alternative for Chicago residents and visitors.
As the company has grown, it has expanded its services and customer base. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Lily, the company's marketing director, suggests focusing on converting casual riders into annual members rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers.
She notes that casual riders are already aware of the service but need more incentives to become annual members.
This case study aims to analyze the usage patterns of Cyclistic's bike-share program and identify strategies to increase annual memberships. 
The data for this analysis comes from Cyclistic's historical trip data, customer surveys, and financial records.
# DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
# ASK: DEFINING THE PROBLEM
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analysing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

These three questions will guide the future marketing program:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
Our first business task is to identify how annual members, and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Understanding how these two different customer profiles interact with the company’s offerings is key to designing effective marketing strategies that convert casual riders to annual memberships while using data to drive these decisions and fuel the company’s future growth.
