# CYCLISTIC-BIKE-SHARE-ANALYSIS-CASE-STUDY
# INTRODUCTION
Cyclistic is a bike-share program based in Chicago, USA. Launched in 2016, the program aims to provide an eco-friendly and convenient transportation alternative for Chicago residents and visitors.
As the company has grown, it has expanded its services and customer base. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Lily, the company's marketing director, suggests focusing on converting casual riders into annual members rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers.
She notes that casual riders are already aware of the service but need more incentives to become annual members.
This case study aims to analyze the usage patterns of Cyclistic's bike-share program and identify strategies to increase annual memberships. 
The data for this analysis comes from Cyclistic's historical trip data, customer surveys, and financial records.
# DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
# ASK: DEFINING THE PROBLEM
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analysing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

These three questions will guide the future marketing program:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
Our first business task is to identify how annual members, and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Understanding how these two different customer profiles interact with the companyâ€™s offerings is key to designing effective marketing strategies that convert casual riders to annual memberships while using data to drive these decisions and fuel the companyâ€™s future growth. 
# PREPARE
We will be using Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.

It is important to note that due to data-privacy issues, we are unable to use ridersâ€™ personally identifiable information, meaning we cannot connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
Additionally, we can ensure the integrity and reliability of the data using the ROCCC test.
*	The data is reliable. It is reflective of the population.
*	The data is original. The primary source can be located.
*	The data is comprehensive. It contains the necessary critical information to solve the task at hand.
*	The data is current. We are using relevant data from the past 12 months.
*  The data is cited. It is from a vetted and credible source

# DATA VISUALIZATION

This code calculates the total number of rides and average ride duration for each user type and day of the week. Then it creates a grouped bar plot with ggplot to display the total number of rides by user type on different days of the week. 
```R
bike_share %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(start_time, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(usertype, weekday) %>%
  summarise(

  ) %>%
  arrange(usertype, weekday) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = usertype)) +

The number of rides taken by customers is significantly greater in comparison to that of subscribers. This suggests that customers tend to utilize the ride-sharing service more frequenty than subscribers.

# Recommendations
1. Customer Engagement Strategies
After analyzing the data, it was found that customers tend to use Cyclistic bikes for longer rides compared to subscribers. To increase customer engagement and loyalty, Cyclistic should consider implementing targeted marketing strategies like promotional offers or rewards programs. These strategies can encourage more frequent usage and longer rides.

2. Operational Optimization on High Traffic Days
The analysis has shown that ride lengths differ on different days of the week. Cyclistic could enhance its operational processes, such as bike distribution and station maintenance, on days when there is more user activity. This could help to enhance to overall efficiency of the service and improve customer satisfaction.

3. Technology Enhancements for Subscriber Experience
A considerable number of users are subscribers, and they usually undertake shorter rides. To improve the overall experience of subscribers and encourage more frequent usage, Cyclistic could prioritize technologies upgrades such as a more advanced mobile app or additional features.

# Conclusion
After analyzing the data of Cyclistic Bike Share, we have gained important insights into the behavior of users and their ride patterns. I recommended implementing the above-mentioned suggestions to enhance customer engagement, operational efficiency, and the overall user experience. These recommendations can significantly contribute to the growth and success of Cyclistic Bike Share.
